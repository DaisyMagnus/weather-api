#weather report

This program is a Ruby application that will summarize information gathered from multiple API endpoints at Weather Underground.

This program will prompt the user for a location.  The location can be in the following formats: a 5 digit postal code, or a city (comma) state.  The program will then return the following information: current temperature, sunrise and sunset times, and the ten day forecast.

Lastly, the program will list if there are any hurricanes active anywhere, however it will not return alerts for a specific location.
